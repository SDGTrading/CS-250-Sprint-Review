# CS-250-Sprint-Review, SNHU

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    User needs are interpreted through the creation of user stories. User stories are created by taking information from end users about feature requests, ideas, or problems and creating tasks to implement. User stories typically are given a priority rating which will help determine if and when the features are implemented. 
    
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    When developing programs I find that using story boards helps me get started. I tend to go through requirements, set priorities, and create pseudocode before i begin programming. In future development work I intend to implement a Scrum-agile approach when it comes to planning, communication, and backlog management. I have found communication to be a key factor in success for a development team and feel that Scrum boards are an excellent tool allowing teams to visualize the tasks at hand.
    
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    Being a good team member means open communication. From this course I have learned how important constant communication and feedback can be to a development team. Daily Scrum meetings, sprint planning, and sprint reviews all provide opportunity to adapt as a team and provide support to other team members when necessary.
